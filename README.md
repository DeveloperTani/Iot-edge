# IoT Edge System + Thermostat Sensor Logger

This project features a physical ESP32-based thermostat (running MicroPython), Azure IoT Edge modules (on Linux Ubuntu 22.04), a FastAPI backend connected to Azure IoT Hub, and a React frontend dashboard for easy control.

I have scaled this project up from a single edge module that read system data using psutil to a full scale pipeline from wiring and flashing + programming up my own thermostat to hooking it up to my edge runtime environment to building an api and frontend to support it.

More detailed documentation of each component is coming soon!

**Status (2025-07-11):**  
Both frontend and backend are deployed on Azure.
The backend cloud-based endpoints are not currently in use and data/commands are routed straight through API --> MQTT broker --> device and vice versa.

See [ESP32 thermostat](./thermostat-prototype/) for device details.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- Azure IoT Hub + IoT Edge Runtime â€“ Device connectivity and module orchestration

- Docker + Azure Container Registry (ACR) â€“ Containerized module build + deployment

- Python 3.10-slim â€“ Base image for custom IoT Edge modules

- FastAPI â€“ Backend API (OAuth2-secured), MQTT control + telemetry

- React + Vite â€“ Frontend dashboard with Entra ID (Azure AD) login

- MSAL (msal-browser / msal-react) â€“ Microsoft Authentication in frontend

- ESP32 (MicroPython) â€“ Custom thermostat hardware (MQTT telemetry + commands)

- paho-mqtt â€“ MQTT client

- Ubuntu 22.04 (VM) â€“ Virtual Machine host for Mosquitto
  
- Ubuntu 22.04 (laptop) Physical host for edge modules

##  Key Features

- `system_reader`: (not in use) Collects system stats using psutil, timestamps in UTC
- `thermostat_reader`: Receives live ESP32 MQTT data, structures payloads
- `cloud_publisher`: Forwards telemetry to IoT Hub using custom routes
- **ESP thermostat**: Sends telemetry and receives commands via MQTT. Powers up an LED if set temperature threshold is met
- **MQTT Broker**: TLS secured Mosquitto broker for message routing
- **Frontend**: React SPA for real-time control + telemetry (auth via Azure Entra ID)
- **API**: Provides direct MQTT endpoints for controlling the device and receiving telemetry
- **Deployment**:

   - Backend (Edge modules + API): Dockerized, stored in ACR, deployed via IoT Edge runtime

   - Frontend: Built and deployed using Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD

##  Sample Telemetry Payloads

**From ESP32 Thermostat:**
```json
{
  "temperature": 25.8,
  "timestamp": "2025-07-04T00:13:36Z",
  "humidity": 44.9,
  "target_temp": 25,
  "device_id": "esp32c3-01",
  "heating": "OFF"
}
```
**From laptop system_reader**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-26T18:55:00.363867Z",
  "cpu_usage": 0.0,
  "memory_usage": 6.6,
  "disk_usage": 0.3
}
```


 ## Future Plans

- âœ…Logic separation into multiple modules with custom routes

- âœ…Custom ESP32 thermostat (temp sensor + relay)

- âœ…Live data from ESP32

- âœ…Direct method invocation from the cloud

- âœ…API and frontend dashboard for easy control (in progress)

- âœ…ESP32 LCD integration

- Power BI integration (if MS dev access comes through)
  
- Machine learning?
