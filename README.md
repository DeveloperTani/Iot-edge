# IoT Edge System + Thermostat Sensor logger

This project is a working prototype of an IoT Edge deployment using a physical Ubuntu laptop as the edge device. It simulates and collects telemetry from two sources:

    The laptopâ€™s own system metrics (CPU, memory, disk)

    A custom-built ESP32-based thermostat sending real-time temperature and humidity data via MQTT

Messages are routed through Dockerized modules and sent upstream to Azure IoT Hub, forming the basis for a remote-monitoring, real-time data platform.

You can check out more of the thermostat here: [ESP32 thermostat](./thermostat-prototype/)



##  Overview
ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

    Azure IoT Hub + IoT Edge runtime

    Docker + Azure Container Registry

    Python 3.10-slim
    
    ESP32 with DHT sensor + relay
    
    Host system: Ubuntu 22.04 (Laptop)

##  Key Features

- system_reader module collects CPU, memory, and disk usage using psutil and timestamps each entry in UTC ISO format
- thermostat_reader module receives live data from an ESP32 over MQTT and forwards structured payloads
- cloud_publisher manages message forwarding to Azure IoT Hub using custom routing
- Modules in containers deployed on a physical Ubuntu host via Azure IoT Edge runtime and Docker
- Images are built and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR) for deployment

##  Sample Telemetry Payloads

from ESP32 thermostat:
```json
{
{"temperature": 25.8,
 "timestamp": "2025-07-04T00:13:36Z",
 "humidity": 44.9,
 "target_temp": 25,
 "device_id": "esp32c3-01",
 "heating": "OFF"}
}
```

from laptop system reader:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-26T18:55:00.363867Z",
  "cpu_usage": 0.0,
  "memory_usage": 6.6,
  "disk_usage": 0.3
}
```

## Future Plans

- Logic separation into multiple modules with custom routes âœ…
- Build a custom Wi-fi "thermostat" using an ESP32, temp sensor and a relay âœ…
- Read live data from the ESP32 thermostat âœ…
- Implement cloud-to-device (C2D) messaging
- Support direct method invocation from the cloud
- Connecting data stream to Power BI (If I get Microsoft dev program access)
- LCD integration on ESP32
